# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

The web app shows animations for 6 different sorting algorithms, making it easier to understand how each algorithm works and what the differences between them are.

## Deployed App

### Tech stack

I used Gatsby with Chakra UI and SCSS modules for the interface and Framer Motion for the sorting animations. The algorithms themselves are written by me in plain JavaScript.

### Run locally

If you want to play around with the project locally, cloning it + `npm install` + `npm start` should suffice.
